## TL;DR

```console
helm install my-release oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/jasperreports
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [JasperReports](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/jasperreports) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

It also packages the [Bitnami MariaDB chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/mariadb) which bootstraps a MariaDB deployment required by the JasperReports application.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.2.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
- ReadWriteMany volumes for deployment scaling

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/jasperreports
```

The command deploys JasperReports on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

The above parameters map to the env variables defined in [bitnami/jasperreports](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/jasperreports). For more information please refer to the [bitnami/jasperreports](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/jasperreports) image documentation.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
helm install my-release \
  --set jasperreportsUsername=admin,jasperreportsPassword=password,mariadb.auth.rootPassword=secretpassword \
    oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/jasperreports
```

The above command sets the JasperReports administrator account username and password to `admin` and `password` respectively. Additionally, it sets the MariaDB `root` user password to `secretpassword`.

> NOTE: Once this chart is deployed, it is not possible to change the application's access credentials, such as usernames or passwords, using Helm. To change these application credentials after deployment, delete any persistent volumes (PVs) used by the chart and re-deploy it, or use the application's built-in administrative tools if available.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/jasperreports
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Configuration and installation details

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/understand-rolling-tags-containers/)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

## Persistence

The [Bitnami JasperReports](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/jasperreports) image stores the JasperReports data and configurations at the `/bitnami/jasperreports` path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube.
See the [Parameters](#parameters) section to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.

### Adding extra environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables (useful for advanced operations like custom init scripts), you can use the `extraEnvVars` property.

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: LOG_LEVEL
    value: DEBUG
```

Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap or a Secret with the environment variables. To do so, use the `extraEnvVarsCM` or the `extraEnvVarsSecret` values.

### Sidecars and Init Containers

If you have a need for additional containers to run within the same pod as the JasperReports app (e.g. an additional metrics or logging exporter), you can do so via the `sidecars` config parameter. Simply define your container according to the Kubernetes container spec.

```yaml
sidecars:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
       containerPort: 1234
```

Similarly, you can add extra init containers using the `initContainers` parameter.

```yaml
initContainers:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
        containerPort: 1234
```

### Setting Pod's affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `affinity` parameter. Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `podAffinityPreset`, `podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

## Upgrading

### To 15.0.0

This major release bumps the MariaDB version to 10.11. Follow the [upstream instructions](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-10-6-to-mariadb-10-11/) for upgrading from MariaDB 10.6 to 10.11. No major issues are expected during the upgrade.

### To 14.0.0

This major release bumps the MariaDB version to 10.6. Follow the [upstream instructions](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-105-to-mariadb-106/) for upgrading from MariaDB 10.5 to 10.6. No major issues are expected during the upgrade.

### To 12.0.0

This major release renames several values in this chart and adds missing features, in order to be inline with the rest of assets in the Bitnami charts repository.

Affected values:

- `service.port` was deprecated, we recommend using `service.ports.http` instead.
- `service.nodePort` was deprecated, we recommend using `service.nodePorts.http` instead .
- `containerPort` was deprecated, we recommend using `containerPorts.http` instead.

Additionally updates the MariaDB subchart to it newest major, 10.0.0, which contains similar changes. Check [MariaDB Upgrading Notes](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/mariadb#to-1000) for more information.

### To 11.0.0

The [Bitnami JasperReports](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/jasperreports) image was migrated to a "non-root" user approach. Previously the container ran as the `root` user and the Tomcat daemon was started as the `tomcat` user. From now on, both the container and the Tomcat daemon run as user `1001`. You can revert this behavior by setting the parameters `containerSecurityContext.runAsUser` to `root`.

Consequences:

- The HTTP/HTTPS ports exposed by the container are now `8080/8443` instead of `80/443`.
- Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

To upgrade to `11.0.0`, backup JasperReports data and the previous MariaDB databases, install a new JasperReports chart and import the backups and data, ensuring the `1001` user has the appropriate permissions on the migrated volume.

In addition to this, the image was refactored and now the source code is published in GitHub in the `rootfs` folder of the container image.

We also fixed a regression with readiness and liveness probes. Now the kind of probe cannot be configured under the *readinessProbe/livenessProbe* sections but in the *customReadinessProbe/customLivenessProbe* sections.

### To 10.0.0

- Chart labels were adapted to follow the [Helm charts standard labels](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/labels/#standard-labels).
- Ingress configuration was also adapted to follow the Helm charts best practices.

Consequences:

- Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed. However, you can easily workaround this issue by removing JasperReports deployment before upgrading (the following example assumes that the release name is `jasperreports`):

```console
export JASPER_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default jasperreports -o jsonpath="{.data.jasperreports-password}" | base64 -d)
export MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default jasperreports-mariadb -o jsonpath="{.data.mariadb-root-password}" | base64 -d)
export MARIADB_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default jasperreports-mariadb -o jsonpath="{.data.mariadb-password}" | base64 -d)
kubectl delete deployments.apps jasperreports
helm upgrade jasperreports oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/jasperreports --set jasperreportsPassword=$JASPER_PASSWORD,mariadb.auth.rootPassword=$MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD,mariadb.auth.password=$MARIADB_PASSWORD
```

### To 9.0.0

In this major there were two main changes introduced:

1. Adaptation to Helm v2 EOL
2. Updated MariaDB dependency version

Please read the update notes carefully.

#### 1. Adaptation to Helm v2 EOL

[On November 13, 2020, Helm v2 support was formally finished](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project), this major version is the result of the required changes applied to the Helm Chart to be able to incorporate the different features added in Helm v3 and to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm v2 EOL.

##### What changes were introduced in this major version?

- Previous versions of this Helm Chart use `apiVersion: v1` (installable by both Helm 2 and 3), this Helm Chart was updated to `apiVersion: v2` (installable by Helm 3 only). [Here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field) you can find more information about the `apiVersion` field.
- Move dependency information from the *requirements.yaml* to the *Chart.yaml*
- After running `helm dependency update`, a *Chart.lock* file is generated containing the same structure used in the previous *requirements.lock*
- The different fields present in the *Chart.yaml* file has been ordered alphabetically in a homogeneous way for all the Bitnami Helm Charts

##### Considerations when upgrading to this version

- If you want to upgrade to this version from a previous one installed with Helm v3, you shouldn't face any issues
- If you want to upgrade to this version using Helm v2, this scenario is not supported as this version doesn't support Helm v2 anymore
- If you installed the previous version with Helm v2 and wants to upgrade to this version with Helm v3, please refer to the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/#migration-use-cases) about migrating from Helm v2 to v3

#### 2. Updated MariaDB dependency version

In this major the MariaDB dependency version was also bumped to a new major version that introduces several incompatilibites. Therefore, backwards compatibility is not guaranteed unless an external database is used. Check [MariaDB Upgrading Notes](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/mariadb#to-800) for more information.

To upgrade to `9.0.0`, it should be done reusing the PVCs used to hold both the MariaDB and JasperReports data on your previous release. To do so, follow the instructions below (the following example assumes that the release name is `jasperreports` and that a `rootUser.password` was defined for MariaDB in `values.yaml` when the chart was first installed):

> NOTE: Please, create a backup of your database before running any of those actions. The steps below would be only valid if your application (e.g. any plugins or custom code) is compatible with MariaDB 10.5.x

Obtain the credentials and the names of the PVCs used to hold both the MariaDB and JasperReports data on your current release:

```console
export JASPERREPORTS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default jasperreports -o jsonpath="{.data.jasperreports-password}" | base64 -d)
export MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default jasperreports-mariadb -o jsonpath="{.data.mariadb-root-password}" | base64 -d)
export MARIADB_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default jasperreports-mariadb -o jsonpath="{.data.mariadb-password}" | base64 -d)
export MARIADB_PVC=$(kubectl get pvc -l app=mariadb,component=master,release=jasperreports -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
```

Delete the JasperReports deployment and delete the MariaDB statefulset. Notice the option `--cascade=false` in the latter:

```console
  kubectl delete deployments.apps jasperreports

  kubectl delete statefulsets.apps jasperreports-mariadb --cascade=false
```

Now the upgrade works:

```console
helm upgrade jasperreports oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/jasperreports --set mariadb.primary.persistence.existingClaim=$MARIADB_PVC --set mariadb.auth.rootPassword=$MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD --set mariadb.auth.password=$MARIADB_PASSWORD --set jasperreportsPassword=$JASPERREPORTS_PASSWORD --set allowEmptyPasswords=false
```

You will have to delete the existing MariaDB pod and the new statefulset is going to create a new one

  ```console
  kubectl delete pod jasperreports-mariadb-0
  ```

Finally, you should see the lines below in MariaDB container logs:

```console
$ kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=jasperreports,app.kubernetes.io/name=mariadb,app.kubernetes.io/component=primary -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
...
mariadb 12:13:24.98 INFO  ==> Using persisted data
mariadb 12:13:25.01 INFO  ==> Running mysql_upgrade
...
```

### To 8.0.0

JasperReports 7.5.0 includes some new configuration options that are required to be added if you upgrade from previous versions. Please check the [official community guide](https://community.jaspersoft.com/documentation/tibco-jasperreports-server-upgrade-guide/v750/upgrading-72-75) to upgrade your previous JasperReports installation.

### To 7.0.0

Helm performs a lookup for the object based on its group (apps), version (v1), and kind (Deployment). Also known as its GroupVersionKind, or GVK. Changing the GVK is considered a compatibility breaker from Kubernetes' point of view, so you cannot "upgrade" those objects to the new GVK in-place. Earlier versions of Helm 3 did not perform the lookup correctly which has since been fixed to match the spec.

In <https://github.com/helm/charts/pull/17298> the `apiVersion` of the deployment resources was updated to `apps/v1` in tune with the api's deprecated, resulting in compatibility breakage.

This major version signifies this change.

### To 3.0.0

Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed unless you modify the labels used on the chart's deployments.
Use the workaround below to upgrade from versions previous to 3.0.0. The following example assumes that the release name is jasperreports:

```console
kubectl patch deployment jasperreports-jasperreports --type=json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/selector/matchLabels/chart"}]'
kubectl delete statefulset jasperreports-mariadb --cascade=false
```

## Community supported solution

Please, note this Helm chart is a community-supported solution. This means that the Bitnami team is not actively working on new features/improvements nor providing support through GitHub Issues for this Helm chart. Any new issue will stay open for 20 days to allow the community to contribute, after 15 days without activity the issue will be marked as stale being closed after 5 days.

The Bitnami team will review any PR that is created, feel free to create a PR if you find any issue or want to implement a new feature.

New versions are not going to be affected. Once a new version is released in the upstream project, the Bitnami container image will be updated to use the latest version.
